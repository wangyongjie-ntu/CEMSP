T3 and T4 is controlled by TSH.
Low T4 results in more production of TSH that initiates thyroid gland to produce more T4.

Low TSH and elevated T4 indicates hyperthyoidism.
A low TSH and low T4 indicates secondary hypothyroidism.
A high TSH and low T4 indicates primary hypothyroidism.

T3 test is used for determining the severity of the hyperthyoidism or to diagnose the hyperthyroidism.
